I've been working on PHP web apps for years, and over time, my development workflow has remained fairly constant:

1. Configure new app in apache/nginx
2. Starting coding to find out my environment is broken
3. Fix my environment
4. Continue coding
5. Get bored
6. See step 1

Managing DevOps items when I should be focusing on building a product is not beneficial to my productivity.

## Enter [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).

Ever wanted to have a dev environment built for you automatically? Yeah, who doesn't? Vagrant can do that for you. With the help of Oracle's [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), Vagrant creates a virtual machine, can provision it with the packages and services you define in a text file, and creates helpful links in between your host OS and the guest OS.

## [Phalcon PHP](http://www.phalconphp.com/)

I need to write another post entitled "Phalcon is Awesome". I've only recently started to develop with the C-extension based PHP framework, but boy does it pack a punch. One phrase before I do a write-up: [~800 requests per second][1].

The only downside of using Phalcon is having to compile and load it for use by PHP. `git clone`-ing the [cphalon repo](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon) and running the build script is easy enough, but what if you're getting help from a creative that has no idea how to set up a virtual host on their local machine, let alone compiling a PHP extension?

## Use Vagrant, of course!

I've been using Vagrant to host a Phalcon project for a while, and I managed to extract out the Vagrant goodies into a stand-alone project: [vagrant-phalcon](https://github.com/slogsdon/vagrant-phalcon).  With the help of a Puppet manifest and a bash script, vagrant-phalcon helps developers of all skill levels start with Phalcon with an easy `vagrant up` command. Details from the README.md:

> #### Getting Started
>
> 1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
> 2. Download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
> 3. Clone this repo
> 4. Run `vagrant up` in the repo directory
> 5. Visit `http://localhost:8081/` in your favorite browser
>
> ##### Note
>
> Nginx is configured by default to use `./src/Public/` as the root directory.  If your public directory differs, be sure to update the `Vagrantfile` to  reflect your needs.

While not perfect, it does the job of setting up a Phalcon dev environment quite well, so I felt content with releasing it out into the wild. Happen to find a problem with it or have a suggestion? Submit an [issue](https://github.com/slogsdon/vagrant-phalcon/issues), or better yet, submit a [pull-request](https://github.com/slogsdon/vagrant-phalcon/pulls).
