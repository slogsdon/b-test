I recently discussed ways of [migrating your site without killing your SEO presence](http://shane.logsdon.io/posts/devops/migrate-your-site-without-killing-your-search-engine-presence/) and, as an example, noted some of the steps I took in migrating my site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Let's take a deeper look in getting more control over your domain when hosting your site with GitHub.

## Pro's and Con's of GitHub Pages

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 50%;">Pro's</th>
            <th style="width: 50%;">Con's</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Fast</td>
            <td>No SSL</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Simple Deployment</td>
            <td>No 301's</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DDOS Protection</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
